# robot-wars
The project was created for my Web Development Immersive Unit 1 assignment.

Inspired from the countless hours ~~wasted~~ spent playing x-COM, Robot Wars is a turn-based strategy game in which the objective is to seek and destroy all enemy robots with a team of 3 robots.

## Basic Guide

### Turns
Each robot will be granted a turn when their cooldown reaches 0. Attacking or moving the robot will consume the robot's turn.

### Grass
Robots hidden in the grass will take 40% less damage when shot upon.

### Combat
The probability of hitting your target depends on the distance between the attacker and the target. The further the distance, the higher the chance the shot will miss.

When robot's gun is out of ammo, the next attack will be spent reloading.
